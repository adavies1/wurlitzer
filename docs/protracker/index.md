# Protracker

Protracker was a music tracker program written by [Lars Hamre](http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?id=5273) for the Amiga home computer system. While the format was used predominantly on the Amiga, replay code was also written for other systems, such as the Atari ST and the IBM compatible home computers (those with a sound card, like the SoundBlaster Pro).

Much of the documentation here is based upon the brilliant documentation by Thunder, written many years ago. A copy of that is stored [here](MODFIL12.TXT). Even with all of the help from that document, there was still a lot of googling and head-scratching done on my part, so I have attempted to write up my findings here. I hope they are useful.
